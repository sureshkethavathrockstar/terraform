In the above block of code, we are using a vpc and a subnet that is already created on AWS. 
Then using data block, which refers to data sources, 
that is, a vpc and a subnet. By doing this, we are retrieving the information about the vpc and subnet that are created outside of terraform configuration. 
Then creating a security group that uses vpc_id that was fetched using data block. Further creating the EC2 instance that uses the subnet_id that was also fetched using data block.
So, in this example, data source is being used to get data about the vpc and subnet that were not created using terraform script and using this data further for creating an EC2.
